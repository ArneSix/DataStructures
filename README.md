# Data Structures Easy to Advanced

This is a collection of different data structures implemented in C#. This course
can be found on Youtube and contains 8 hours of different algorithms explained by
a google engineer named Williamfiset who is linked down below.

I decided to implement the theory of these algorithms into code without looking at
the source code on how to do it, this gave me a challenge to think how I would solve
these problems and have a deeper understanding when to use certain data structures.

The code in the video was programmed with Java, I decided to try to implement the 
basic functionality of these structures in C#.
